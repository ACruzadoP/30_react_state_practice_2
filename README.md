<br />
Given a stateless functional component, add state to it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State should have a property called `isLoggedIn` which is a boolean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(true if logged in, false if not)<br />

<br />
Then, give your best shot at rendering the word "in" if the user is logged in or "out" if the user is logged out.
